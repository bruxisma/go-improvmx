`go-improvmx` is a golang wrapper around the [ImprovMX][1] [API][2]. It was
written primarily for a [terraform][3] provider, however others might get use
out of it.

## Installation

Inside your `go.mod`, add

```
require occult.work/improvmx
```

## Development

`go-improvmx` uses [`task`][4] to run the most common operations. These tasks
are then duplicated with extra flags within the GitHub Actions workflow.

Task has [instructions on installation](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation).
Once installed, simply run `task` from the project directory.
